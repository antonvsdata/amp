\title{Logistic regression}
\usage{
perform_logistic(object, formula_char, all_features = FALSE,
  ci_level = 0.95, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{a MetaboSet object}

\item{formula_char}{character, the formula to be used in the linear model (see Details)}

\item{ci_level}{the confidence level used in constructing the confidence intervals
for regression coefficients}

\item{...}{additional parameters passed to glm}
}
\value{
a data frame with one row per feature, with all the
relevant statistics of the linear model as columns
}
\description{
Fits a logistic regression model separately for each feature. Returns all relevant
statistics.
}
\details{
The logistic regression model is fit on combined_data(object). Thus, column names
in pData(object) can be specified. To make the formulas flexible, the word "Feature"
must be used to signal the role of the features in the formula. "Feature" will be replaced
by the actual Feature IDs during model fitting, see the example
}
\examples{
# A simple example without QC samples
# Features predicted by Group and Time
results <- perform_logistic(drop_qcs(example_set), formula_char = "Feature ~ Group + Time")
