This vignette provides a short summary of many of the functions for accessing elements of MetaboSet objects and other utility functions.

These functions from Biobase might be useful:

- ```fData```: access feature data  
- ```pData```: access pheno data/sample information  
- ```exprs```: access feature abundances


Functions for MetaboSet in particular:

- ```group_col```, ```time_col``` and ```subject_col``` for the special column names  
- ```quality``` for the quality metrics of signals  
- ```combined_data``` for a data frame with sample information and feature abundances as columns (one row per smaple).  
- ```results``` access and set results  
- ```write_to_excel``` writes the whole object to an Excel spreadsheet
